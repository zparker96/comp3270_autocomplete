NO-PLAGIARISM CERTIFICATION: I certify that I wrote the code I am submitting. I
did not copy whole or parts of it from another student or have another person
write the code for me. Any code I am reusing in my program from the web or
some other source is clearly marked as such with its source clearly identified in
comments.

Source files:
Autocomplete.java
AutocompleteTest.java

My program was compiled and run using jGRASP v2.0.3 on a Windows 8.1 machine. 
The above source files (in addition to the rest of the source files that were 
provided for this project) must simply be in the same folder to properly compile.
